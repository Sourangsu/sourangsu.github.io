	Hi! I am Sourangsu Banerji!
	<br/>
	<br/>
    I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Utah,currently advised by Prof. Berardi Sensale-Rodriguez.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	My current research interests are in the areas of diffractive optics, metamaterials, plasmonics, and nanophotonics, with an emphasis on utilizing computational approaches (that are neither time-consuming nor memory-intensive yet readily scalable) towards their design. In this context, I have extensively worked on translating and exploiting well-established methods and concepts from computer science engineering right up to the realm of optics and photonics by demonstrating the computational design of planar, passive and reconfigurable integrated nanophotonic and free-space diffractive optical devices.
