	Hi! I am Sourangsu Banerji!
	<br/>
	<p align = 'justify'>
    I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Utah,currently advised by Prof. Berardi Sensale-Rodriguez 
	and co-adviced by Prof. Rajesh Menon.
    <p/>	
	<p align = 'justify'>
	My current research interests are in the areas of diffractive optics, metamaterials, plasmonics, nanotechnology and nanophotonics with particular focus on 
	computational approaches aimed towards their design. In this context, I have extensively worked on translating and exploiting well-established methods and 
	concepts from computer science engineering right upto the realm of optics and photonics by demonstrating the computational design of planar passive and 
	reconfigurable nano-scale devices in the THz/visible regime.Nonetheless, my work also includes looking into several different optimization algorithms as well 
	as machine learning techniques for possible use in designing  photonic and optical devices. 
	<p/>
	<p align = 'justify'>
 	My work in general, caters to the growing need for designing challenging complicated THz/visible devices by employing computational approachs which is not memory 
	intensive, time consuming, and readily scalable.
