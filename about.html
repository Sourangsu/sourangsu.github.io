	Hi! I am Sourangsu Banerji!
	<br/>
	<br/>
    I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Utah,currently advised by Prof. Berardi Sensale-Rodriguez  and Prof. Rajesh Menon.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	My current research interests are in the areas of diffractive optics, metamaterials, plasmonics, nanotechnology and nanophotonics with an emphasis on utilizing computational approaches towards their design. 
	In this context, I have extensively worked on translating and exploiting well-established methods and concepts from computer science engineering right up to the realm of optics and photonics by demonstrating the computational design of planar passive and reconfigurable nano-scale devices in the THz/visible regime. 
	Nonetheless, my work also includes looking into several different optimization algorithms as well as machine learning techniques for possible use in designing on-chip integrated nanophotonic and free space optical devices. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
 	My work caters to the growing need for designing challenging and complicated devices/systems by employing computational approaches which are neither time consuming not memory intensive yet readily scalable.
