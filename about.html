	Hi! I am Sourangsu Banerji!
	<br/>
	<br/>
    I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Utah advised by Prof. Berardi Sensale-Rodriguez.
	<br/>
	<br/>
    My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, electromagnetics, optics, photonics, and advanced manufacturing. My aim is to design and develop advanced intelligent hardware-software systems through employing computational approaches that are neither time-consuming nor memory-intensive yet readily scalable. During my research career, I received several awards, including the best paper award in Imaging Systems and Applications at the 2019 OSA Imaging and Applied Optics Congress. I am author or co-author of 25 journal articles, 25 conference proceeding papers, 1 book chapters, 30+ conference presentations, and delivered 3 invited talks and seminars. My h-index is 13 with 600+ citations according to Google Scholar.
