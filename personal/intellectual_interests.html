					<strong>Faculty Application Packet (Tenure Track/Non-Tenure Track/Adjunct/Visitng) materials</strong><br/>
				    After applying for nearly <b>~300 faculty job advertisements</b> in various categories (Tenure Track/Non-Tenure Track/Adjunct/Visitng) over the course of <b>2 years</b>, I have finally decided <b>"to throw in the towel"</b> and transition to an industry role.<br/>	
					<br/>
					My success rate was ~0.005% (2 out of ~300). Even those 2 were just first round phone call interviews.<br/> 	
					<br/> 
					I have provided my own application packet materials below:<br/> 
					<a href="../files/cover_letter.pdf" target="_blank">Cover Letter</a> (I don't know why the font looks a bit messed up)<br/>
					<a href="../files/cv.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculam Vitae</a> (This will point to my latest CV!)<br/>
					<a href="../files/teaching_statement.pdf" target="_blank">Teaching Statement</a><br/>
					<a href="../files/research_statement.pdf" target="_blank">Research Statement</a><br/>
					<a href="../files/diversity_statement.pdf" target="_blank">Diversity Statement</a><br/>
					<br/>
					Feel free to use any of my application packet materials (in your own application if you want to) without hesitation!<br/>
					<br/>
					Also feel free to look into the materials provided by my own Ph.D. advisor regarding <b>"Grad school, applications to academic positions, how to be successful in academia."</b> They are provided below: <br/> 
					<a href="../files/presentation_grad_school.pdf" target="_blank">Part 1</a><br/>
					<a href="../files/presentation_faculty_application_tenure.pdf" target="_blank">Part 2</a><br/>
					<br/>
					During this time, I have also attended a lot of these "so-called" faculty application workships. <b>All of these workshops are "bullshit"</b> in my opinion. However, if these workshops are offered for free then attend them else don't even bother. <br/>
					<br/>
					<b>My final 2 cents:</b><br/>
					1: If someone in the "Faculty Hiring Committee" wants to hire (or know) you, they will hire you nonetheless irrespective of whether you are even the most qualified candidate or not! So keep netwokring with people... :)<br/> 
					2: All of the dialogues presented above <b>"specifically" </b> apply to universites located within the US. Whether the same is true for universities in other parts of the world is for the reader to decide.<br/>  	
					<br/>
					I have received a lot of personal emails from people who disagree with this. It is upto you to "agree" or "disagree" with some or all of the points above. I have shared my 2 years worth of experience which is a "tiny" subset compared to the age of this entire universe... ;)<br/>
