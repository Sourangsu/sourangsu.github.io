					<strong>Learn!</strong><br/>
					I was a never a "Top" or "High-Performer" student in either school or even during my undergrads. I was a "good" student. At times, while talking to my old friends and peers I have realised that my old friends feel that I might have got really "lucky" in life to be where I am today! I do not deny that. Honestly speaking! They are way more talented and intellectually superior than me. I constantly learn from them. I am grateful to life for what it has bestowed on me (being an "average joe").</br>
					I cannot change my past but I can pledge to <b>"Learn"</b> so as to be a better and more knowledgable person every single day (be it "techincal" or "non-technical"! Starting today, I commit to learning something new every single day. 	
					<br/>

					<b> Certificate don't mean anything to me and hence I don't really intend to use it for anything. However, collecting them can be fun! :) </b>

					<strong>Research in Multilevel Diffractive Optics</strong><br/>
					It is so sad to see that despite efforts being undertaken to revive the field of multilevel diffractive optics, a lot of industrial and academic research funding is going towards meta-optics. 
					I believe people (investors and funding agencies) need to understand that 1 or 2 research groups working in multilevel diffractive optics can never produce the same output compared to ~50+ meta-optics groups. 
					Neither putting "extra" money into those 1 or 2 research groups will also help. <b> One will need to trust the out-going Ph.D. students from those groups, give them opportunitites and fund their research to expand the area and it is only then can you expect good research in multilevel diffractive optics. </b>
					I don't realize what kind of (government as well as industrial) adminstration is this! Even a fool can understand this....
					<b> Research nowadays is a cumulative effort. It is not a "one-man" show. </b>
