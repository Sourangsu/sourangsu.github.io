			<div id="subheader">Study of Electronic & Electromagnetic Properties of One-Dimensional Photonic Crystal</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Synopis:</div>
			<img id="portrait" src="images/proj1.jpg" align="right">The aim here was to study and understand the underlying physics governing the electronic and the electromagnetic properties like the density of states (DOS) which characterized the mode density of the fluctuating vacuum fields enabling us to engineer various quantum-mechanical processes which depended on it, band structure and the characteristics of wave propagation in the light of reflectivity and transmission characteristics of one-dimensional photonic crystal to determine how light will propagate through the crystal structure. Use of AlGaN/GaN material composition in all of the research work was due to the combined advantages of enhanced band offset, lattice mismatch induced piezoelectric effect.Its development suggested the possibility of increased miniaturization and efficiency of computing components and other technologies.

			<div id="subheader">Architectural Design of a RAM Arbiter</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Synopsis:</div>
			Standard memory modules to store (and access) data are designed for use with a single system accessing it. More complicated memory modules would <img id="portrait" src="images/proj2.jpg" align="right"> be accessed through a memory controller, which are also designed for one system.For multiple systems to access a single memory module there must be some facilitation that allows them to access the memory without overriding or corrupting the access from the others. This was done with the use of a memory arbiter, which controls the  flow of traffic into the memory controller. The Address Clash Problem was nicely tackled and solved. The design was verified in simulation and validated on a Xilinx ML605 evaluation board with a Virtex-6 FPGA.

			<div id="subheader">Application of Fractals in Digital Images</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Synopsis:</div>
			In this project we aimed to model one of the important characteristics associated with fractal <img id="portrait" src="images/proj3.jpg" align="right"> geometry i.e. fractal dimension. Since it is widely known that the primary cause of error in any image processing task is the resolution, an analysis of the effect of resolution on fractal dimension was carried out. For varying levels of brightness and contrast, the fractal dimension was also evaluated.  Finally, the variation  of  the fractal dimension on modified images such as high and low grey valued images, edge detected images and filtered images was studied and satisfactory results were obtained.

			<div id="subheader">Theoretical Study of Current Flow through Real Dielectric Material</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Synopsis:</div>
			Mathematical analysis was carried out to calculate the current flow in a real dielectric material.<img id="portrait" src="images/proj4.jpg" align="left">A range of dielectric materials were taken up as a part of this study. Moreover, a comparative analysis was also done with the current flowing through an ideal dielectric. The dissipated energy was also calculated for both the cases (i.e. in the absence as well as the presence of a dielectric) after obtaining current density. The existence of displacement current was established in the case of real dielectric, which was seen to be absent for the ideal one. The results were quite in agreement with the findings in the existing literature.

			<div id="subheader">Design and Implementation of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Synopsis:</div>
			<img id="portrait" src="images/proj5.jpg" align="right">In this project we focused at designing and developing an unmanned surface vehicle. But the major disadvantage of these unmanned robots is that they typically make use of RF circuits for maneuver and control. Essentially RF circuits suffer from a lot of drawbacks such as limited frequency range i.e. working range, and limited control. A wireless system for maneuvering the vehicle without the use of the conventional RF circuits was also implemented.
